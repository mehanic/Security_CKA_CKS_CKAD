bpf_printk("PID: %u, FD: %d, Data: %s, Count: %lu\n", pid, fd, data, count);
bpf_printk is a helper function that allows you to print logs to the kernel log (dmesg). It logs the following information:
PID: The process ID that called write.
FD: The file descriptor passed to the write() syscall.
Data: The data being written (up to the first 127 characters of the buffer).
Count: The number of bytes requested to be written.
