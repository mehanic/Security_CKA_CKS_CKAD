### **Explanation of the `CiliumNetworkPolicy` for `l3-rule`**

This policy defines an **ingress rule** that **restricts incoming traffic to `env=prod` pods**, allowing access **only from pods with the label `role=frontend`**.

---

### **Breakdown of the Policy:**

1. **Metadata:**
   - `name: "l3-rule"` → The name of the policy.

2. **`specs` (Policy Definition):**
   - **`description`**:  
     - Explains that for endpoints labeled `env=prod`, ingress traffic is only allowed if the source has `role=frontend`.

3. **`endpointSelector`**:  
   - `matchLabels:`  
     - `env: prod` → This policy applies to **all pods labeled `env=prod`**.

4. **Ingress Rule (`ingress`)**
   - **`fromEndpoints`**:  
     - `matchLabels:`  
       - `role: frontend` → Only allows ingress traffic from pods that have the label `role=frontend`.

---

### **What This Policy Does:**
✅ **Allows ingress traffic** to `env=prod` pods **only if the source pod has `role=frontend`**.  
❌ **Blocks all other sources** (including pods with other roles or missing labels).  
✅ Provides **Layer 3 (L3) restrictions**, ensuring that only explicitly allowed sources can communicate.

---

### **Use Cases:**
1. **Application Segmentation:**  
   - Ensures that only `frontend` services can communicate with `prod` services.
   - Prevents access from unauthorized or unrelated workloads.

2. **Security & Access Control:**  
   - Blocks traffic from other environments (e.g., `staging`, `dev`) unless explicitly labeled as `frontend`.
   - Protects backend services from unintended access.

3. **Multi-Tier Microservices Architecture:**  
   - Typically, frontend services (UI, API gateways) interact with backend services.
   - This rule ensures that **only frontend components** can reach `env=prod` workloads.
