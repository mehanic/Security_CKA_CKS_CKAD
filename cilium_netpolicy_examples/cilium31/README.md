This `CiliumNetworkPolicy` controls **egress** traffic for a set of Kubernetes pods. Specifically, it applies to pods labeled with `org: empire` and `class: mediabot`. The policy governs what external services these pods can communicate with and the rules for DNS communication within the cluster.

### Breakdown of the Policy

#### **Metadata Section**

```yaml
metadata:
  name: "fqdn"
```
- **name**: This is the name of the network policy, which is `"fqdn"`. It is used to identify this policy within Cilium.

#### **Spec Section**

```yaml
spec:
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      org: empire
      class: mediabot
```
- **endpointSelector**: This policy targets pods with the following labels:
  - `org: empire`
  - `class: mediabot`
  
This means the policy is only applied to pods with these labels. Specifically, it applies to the `mediabot` class of the `empire` organization.

#### **Egress Section**

This section defines the allowed outbound traffic for the selected pods. There are two rules in this egress section:

1. **Egress to GitHub (matching `*.github.com`)**:

```yaml
  - toFQDNs:
    - matchPattern: "*.github.com"
    toPorts:
    - ports:
      - port: "443"
        protocol: TCP
```

- **toFQDNs**: This rule specifies that traffic is allowed to any domain that matches the pattern `*.github.com`. The `*` is a wildcard, so this includes all subdomains of `github.com`, such as `api.github.com`, `raw.githubusercontent.com`, `gist.github.com`, etc.
- **toPorts**: The traffic is allowed to **port 443** (HTTPS), and the protocol must be **TCP**. This ensures that the `mediabot` pods can securely access any GitHub subdomain using HTTPS.

2. **Egress to the Kubernetes DNS service**:

```yaml
  - toEndpoints:
      - matchLabels:
          "k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace": kube-system
          "k8s:k8s-app": kube-dns
    toPorts:
    - ports:
        - port: "53"
          protocol: ANY
      rules:
        dns:
          - matchPattern: "*"
```

- **toEndpoints**: This rule allows egress traffic to the **Kubernetes DNS service** in the `kube-system` namespace. It selects the pods with the labels:
  - `k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace: kube-system`
  - `k8s:k8s-app: kube-dns`

These labels identify the DNS service (either `kube-dns` or `CoreDNS`, depending on the Kubernetes setup).

- **toPorts**: The rule allows communication on **port 53** (the DNS standard port), and the protocol is set to `ANY`, meaning both **TCP** and **UDP** protocols are allowed for DNS traffic.
- **dns rules**: The DNS rule allows queries to be made for **any domain** (`matchPattern: "*"`) in the DNS system. This means the `mediabot` pods can resolve domain names (both internal and external) using the DNS service in the `kube-system` namespace.

### **Summary of Rules**

1. **Egress to GitHub**:
   - Pods labeled with `org: empire` and `class: mediabot` are allowed to send **HTTPS traffic** (port 443, TCP) to **any subdomain of `github.com`** (e.g., `api.github.com`, `raw.githubusercontent.com`, etc.). This could be used to allow the pods to access GitHub resources like APIs, repositories, or raw files.

2. **Egress to Kubernetes DNS**:
   - These same pods are allowed to send traffic to the **Kubernetes DNS service** (`kube-dns` or `CoreDNS`) in the `kube-system` namespace. This is done on **port 53** (DNS port) and allows both TCP and UDP traffic.
   - The DNS rule allows them to query for **any domain name**, meaning the `mediabot` pods can resolve domain names for any internal or external resource.

### **Key Points**
- The policy primarily controls **outbound traffic** (egress) from the `mediabot` pods.
- It specifically allows the pods to reach:
  - **Any subdomain of `github.com`** over HTTPS (port 443, TCP).
  - The **Kubernetes DNS service** for DNS resolution (port 53, TCP/UDP).
- The policy does not restrict **ingress** traffic (incoming traffic to the pods), only outbound traffic is defined.

This policy ensures that the `mediabot` pods can access the GitHub API or repositories and can perform DNS queries, while restricting any other egress traffic outside of these defined destinations.
