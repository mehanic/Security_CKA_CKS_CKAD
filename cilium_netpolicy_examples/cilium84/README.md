### **CiliumNetworkPolicy: `backend-policy`**

This policy controls the traffic **ingress** (incoming) and **egress** (outgoing) for pods labeled with `tier: backend`. The policy defines where the `backend` tier can receive traffic from and where it can send traffic to.

---

### **Policy Breakdown**

```yaml
metadata:
  name: backend-policy
```
- **Metadata**:
  - **name: `backend-policy`**: The name of the policy is `backend-policy`. This suggests that the policy controls network traffic for the backend tier of the application.

---

### **Endpoint Selector**
```yaml
endpointSelector:
  matchLabels:
    tier: backend
```
- **endpointSelector**: This selector is used to match pods that have the label `tier: backend`. 
  - **Effect**: The policy applies to pods with the label `tier: backend`. Only the backend tier pods will be subject to the ingress and egress rules.

---

### **Ingress Rules**
```yaml
ingress:
  - fromEndpoints:
      - matchLabels:
          tier: frontend
    toPorts:
      - ports:
          - port: "80"
```
- **Ingress Rule**:
  - **fromEndpoints**: The rule allows incoming traffic from pods labeled `tier: frontend`.
    - **Effect**: The `backend` pods can receive traffic from the `frontend` tier.
  - **toPorts**: The incoming traffic is restricted to **port 80**.
    - **Effect**: Only HTTP traffic (port 80) is allowed from `frontend` pods to `backend` pods.

---

### **Egress Rules**
```yaml
egress:
  - toEndpoints:
      - matchLabels:
          tier: database
    toPorts:
      - ports:
          - port: "7379"
  - toFQDNs:
      - matchPattern: "*.cloud.google.com"
    toPorts:
      - ports:
          - port: "443"
          - port: "80"
  - toEndpoints:
      - matchLabels:
          io.kubernetes.pod.namespace: kube-system
          k8s-app: kube-dns
    toPorts:
      - ports:
          - port: "53"
            protocol: UDP
        rules:
          dns:
            - matchPattern: "*"
```

#### **First Egress Rule: `toEndpoints`**
- **toEndpoints**: Allows traffic from `backend` pods to **`database` tier** pods (those with the label `tier: database`).
  - **Effect**: The `backend` pods can send traffic to `database` pods on **port 7379**, typically used for Redis or other services.
  
#### **Second Egress Rule: `toFQDNs`**
- **toFQDNs**: Allows traffic to any **FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)** matching `*.cloud.google.com` (for example, `compute.googleapis.com`, `storage.googleapis.com`, etc.).
  - **Effect**: The `backend` pods can access any endpoint within the `cloud.google.com` domain. The allowed ports are:
    - **port 443** (HTTPS) for secure communication.
    - **port 80** (HTTP) for standard web traffic.

#### **Third Egress Rule: `toEndpoints` (DNS)**
- **toEndpoints**: Allows traffic to the **Kubernetes DNS service** in the `kube-system` namespace (`k8s-app: kube-dns`).
  - **Effect**: The `backend` pods are allowed to send DNS queries to the `kube-dns` pods.
- **toPorts**: The rule applies to **port 53** (the DNS port) and uses **UDP** as the protocol.
  - **Effect**: The `backend` pods can perform DNS lookups via the `kube-dns` service, ensuring that they can resolve domain names within the Kubernetes cluster.

### **Summary of Policy Effects**

| **Traffic Direction** | **Source/Destination**                        | **Allowed Traffic**                                                  |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ingress (Incoming)** | `tier: frontend`                              | Traffic to `tier: backend` pods is allowed only on **port 80** (HTTP). |
| **Egress (Outgoing)**  | `tier: database`                              | Traffic from `tier: backend` pods to `tier: database` pods is allowed on **port 7379**. |
| **Egress (Outgoing)**  | `*.cloud.google.com`                          | Traffic from `tier: backend` pods to `*.cloud.google.com` is allowed on **ports 443** (HTTPS) and **80** (HTTP). |
| **Egress (Outgoing)**  | `kube-system/k8s-app: kube-dns`               | Traffic from `tier: backend` pods to Kubernetes DNS is allowed on **port 53 (UDP)** for DNS queries. |

### **Explanation of Traffic Flow**

1. **Ingress (from frontend to backend)**:
   - The `backend` pods are allowed to receive HTTP traffic (port 80) from the `frontend` pods. This setup is common in a web application where frontend pods (such as web servers) communicate with backend services (such as APIs or databases).

2. **Egress to the database**:
   - The `backend` pods can send traffic to the `database` pods on **port 7379**, which could be used by a database service (e.g., Redis). This allows the backend to interact with the database to read/write data.

3. **Egress to Google Cloud**:
   - The `backend` pods are allowed to access any service in the `cloud.google.com` domain on both **HTTP (80)** and **HTTPS (443)**. This is useful for backend services needing to communicate with Google Cloud APIs, storage, etc.

4. **Egress to Kubernetes DNS**:
   - The `backend` pods can communicate with the Kubernetes DNS service (`kube-dns`), allowing them to resolve domain names inside the cluster. The rule specifies **DNS queries over UDP on port 53**, which is the standard protocol for DNS.

---

### **Use Cases for This Policy**

- **Frontend-to-Backend Communication**: This policy ensures that the backend service can only receive traffic from the frontend service on HTTP, providing controlled access between application tiers.
  
- **Database Access**: The backend service is allowed to communicate with the database on a specific port, ensuring secure and limited access to sensitive services.

- **Cloud API Access**: The backend pods are permitted to communicate with external services, like Google Cloud, using standard web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS).

- **DNS Resolution**: The backend pods are able to query Kubernetes DNS, allowing them to resolve internal services and external domains (if required).

---

### **Further Considerations**

- **Granularity of Rules**: You can tighten the rules to only allow specific subdomains under `*.cloud.google.com` or restrict access to certain IP ranges instead of allowing general access to the entire domain.
  
- **Database Ports**: If the `database` tier uses a different port or protocol, you can adjust the port in the egress rule for tighter security.

- **Kubernetes DNS Customization**: If using a custom DNS service or need more restrictive rules for DNS, you can modify the rule to match a specific set of domains or query types.
