  - toEntities:
    - world  # Allow access to the external world


# In Cilium's Layer 3 policies, the entity that represents the collection of all endpoints outside of the cluster is:

# world entity üåç
# Explanation:
# The world entity in Cilium represents all external (non-cluster) endpoints.
# This includes any IP addresses that are not part of the Kubernetes cluster, such as:
# Internet destinations
# External services (e.g., APIs, cloud services)
# Public networks
# Example: Allowing Pods to Access External Internet
# If you want to allow all pods to access external websites or APIs, you can create a CiliumNetworkPolicy like this:
