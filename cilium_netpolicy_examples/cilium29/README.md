This Cilium `CiliumNetworkPolicy` defines rules for controlling **egress traffic** from pods that are labeled with `org: empire` and `class: mediabot`. It specifies rules that control what destinations these pods are allowed to communicate with.

Let's break down the configuration:

### **Policy Breakdown**

```yaml
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: "fqdn"
```
- **apiVersion**: This policy uses Ciliumâ€™s `v2` API version.
- **kind**: The policy is a `CiliumNetworkPolicy`, which is used for managing traffic policies inside a Kubernetes cluster.
- **metadata**:
  - **name**: The policy is named `fqdn`.

#### **Spec Section**

```yaml
spec:
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      org: empire
      class: mediabot
```
- **spec**: This is the specification of the policy.
  - **endpointSelector**: This defines which pods the policy applies to based on their labels.
    - The policy applies to all pods that have the labels:
      - `org: empire`
      - `class: mediabot`

This means the policy is intended for the pods with the label `org=empire` and `class=mediabot` (likely pods from the "empire" organization that serve a certain function, like a "mediabot" in this case).

#### **Egress Rules**

```yaml
egress:
  - toFQDNs:
    - matchPattern: "*.github.com"
```
- **egress**: The rules under this section define **outbound traffic** (egress) for the selected pods.
  - **toFQDNs**: This allows traffic from the selected pods to a **fully qualified domain name** (FQDN).
    - `matchPattern: "*.github.com"`: This rule allows egress traffic to any subdomain of `github.com`. 
    - So, it permits traffic from the `mediabot` pods to any address that matches `*.github.com`, for example, `api.github.com`, `raw.githubusercontent.com`, etc.

This is useful when you want to allow traffic to a broad set of resources under a specific domain, like accessing multiple GitHub APIs or repositories.

```yaml
  - toEndpoints:
      - matchLabels:
          "k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace": kube-system
          "k8s:k8s-app": kube-dns
    toPorts:
    - ports:
        - port: "53"
          protocol: ANY
      rules:
        dns:
          - matchPattern: "*"
```
- **toEndpoints**: This rule allows egress traffic to specific **endpoints** (pods) within the cluster. 
  - **matchLabels**: This rule selects pods with the labels:
    - `k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace: kube-system` (in the `kube-system` namespace)
    - `k8s:k8s-app: kube-dns` (which is the DNS service in the `kube-system` namespace)
  - **toPorts**: The traffic is allowed to port `53` (the standard DNS port) with **any protocol** (both TCP and UDP).
  - **rules**:
    - **dns**: This section specifies the DNS rules for the allowed traffic. 
      - `matchPattern: "*"`: This rule allows DNS queries for any domain. So the `mediabot` pods can perform DNS lookups for any domain through the DNS service (`kube-dns` in the `kube-system` namespace).

### **Summary of the Rules**

1. **Egress to GitHub**: 
   - The `mediabot` pods are allowed to communicate with any **subdomain** of `github.com` (e.g., `api.github.com`, `raw.githubusercontent.com`, etc.). This is useful for allowing traffic to various GitHub-related services, like APIs or repositories.
   
2. **Egress to DNS**:
   - The `mediabot` pods are allowed to communicate with the `kube-dns` service in the `kube-system` namespace on port 53, using any protocol (TCP/UDP). This is necessary for the `mediabot` pods to perform DNS lookups within the Kubernetes cluster.
   - The rule further specifies that all DNS queries are allowed (`matchPattern: "*"`) meaning these pods can resolve domain names to IPs for any external or internal domain.

### **In Summary:**

This `CiliumNetworkPolicy` allows egress traffic for the `mediabot` pods in the `empire` organization:
- To access **any subdomain** under `github.com`.
- To access the **kube-dns service** in the `kube-system` namespace for DNS resolution, allowing these pods to resolve domain names to IPs.

By controlling both the specific FQDNs and the DNS access, this policy ensures the `mediabot` pods can reach external GitHub services and resolve domain names without unrestricted egress access to other destinations.
