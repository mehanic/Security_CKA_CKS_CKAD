This **CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy** defines a policy for controlling **ingress traffic** to **kube-dns** pods in the **kube-system namespace**. Let's break it down:

### **API Version & Kind**
```yaml
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy
```
- **apiVersion**: This is the version of the Cilium API being used, `cilium.io/v2`.
- **kind**: This indicates the resource type as a `CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy`, meaning it applies cluster-wide within the Kubernetes cluster.

### **Metadata**
```yaml
metadata:
  name: "wildcard-from-endpoints"
```
- **name**: The policy is named `wildcard-from-endpoints`, which indicates that this policy allows ingress traffic from **all Cilium-managed endpoints** in the cluster to **kube-dns** pods.

### **Spec**
The **spec** section defines the actual policy and the rules for traffic flow.

#### **Description**
```yaml
description: "Policy for ingress allow to kube-dns from all Cilium managed endpoints in the cluster"
```
- **description**: This provides a brief explanation of the policy's purpose, which is to **allow ingress traffic** to the `kube-dns` pods in the `kube-system` namespace from **all Cilium-managed endpoints**.

#### **Endpoint Selector**
```yaml
endpointSelector:
  matchLabels:
    k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace: kube-system
    k8s-app: kube-dns
```
- **endpointSelector**: This field defines which **pods** the policy applies to.
  - **matchLabels**: It selects pods that are in the `kube-system` namespace (`k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace: kube-system`) and have the label `k8s-app: kube-dns`. 
    - This ensures that the policy applies only to **`kube-dns` pods** in the `kube-system` namespace.
    - These are typically the DNS service pods used by Kubernetes to resolve DNS queries within the cluster.

#### **Ingress Rules**
```yaml
ingress:
  - fromEndpoints:
    - {}
    toPorts:
    - ports:
      - port: "53"
        protocol: UDP
```
- **ingress**: This section defines rules for **ingress traffic** (incoming traffic to the selected pods).
  
  - **fromEndpoints**: The `{}` here is a **wildcard selector**, meaning it matches **all Cilium-managed endpoints** within the cluster. 
    - In essence, it allows ingress traffic to the `kube-dns` pods from **any endpoint managed by Cilium** (i.e., all other pods and services that are Cilium-aware in the cluster).
    
  - **toPorts**: This defines the allowed traffic destination ports.
    - It specifies that the allowed ingress traffic must be on **port 53** (the standard DNS port), with the **UDP** protocol. 
    - This is because DNS typically uses **UDP port 53** for name resolution, and this rule allows UDP traffic on this port from all endpoints.

### **Summary of the Rules:**

- The policy applies to **`kube-dns` pods** in the `kube-system` namespace (using the `endpointSelector`).
- The **ingress rule** allows traffic from **any Cilium-managed endpoint** in the cluster (due to the wildcard `{}` in `fromEndpoints`).
- The allowed traffic must be on **UDP port 53**, which is the standard port for DNS queries.

### **Use Case:**

This policy ensures that **all pods** within the Kubernetes cluster that are managed by Cilium can **access the `kube-dns` service** (which is essential for DNS resolution within the cluster). The rule:
- Allows DNS queries to `kube-dns` from **any pod or service** that is part of the Cilium network, which is likely to be all the workloads within the Kubernetes cluster.
- Ensures that **DNS resolution** will work as expected across the cluster, allowing all pods to communicate with `kube-dns` to resolve DNS names.

### **Security Consideration:**
- Since this rule allows traffic from **any Cilium-managed endpoint**, it is quite permissive, which is typically acceptable for **DNS traffic** (since DNS needs to be accessible by all pods).
- However, in a more security-conscious environment, additional rules might be added to restrict the sources further, for example, only allowing traffic from trusted or specific namespaces or applications.
