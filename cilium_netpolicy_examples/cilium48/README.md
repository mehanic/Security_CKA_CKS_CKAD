This **CiliumNetworkPolicy** defines egress rules for pods labeled with **app: myService**, restricting outbound traffic to specific CIDR ranges.

### **Breakdown of the Policy:**

#### **1. `endpointSelector`**
```yaml
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myService
```
- This policy applies **only** to pods that have the label **app=myService**.
- Other pods in the cluster are **not affected** by this policy.

#### **2. `egress` rules**
These rules define **allowed outbound connections** from the selected pods.

##### **Rule 1: Allow traffic to a single IP (`toCIDR`)**
```yaml
  - toCIDR:
    - 20.1.1.1/32
```
- Allows outbound traffic **only** to **IP address 20.1.1.1**.
- `/32` means that **only this exact IP** is allowed.

##### **Rule 2: Allow traffic to a CIDR range, except some subnets (`toCIDRSet`)**
```yaml
  - toCIDRSet:
    - cidr: 10.0.0.0/8
      except:
      - 10.96.0.0/12
```
- Allows outbound traffic to the **entire 10.0.0.0/8** subnet **EXCEPT** for **10.96.0.0/12**.
- **`10.0.0.0/8`** includes all addresses from **10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255**.
- **Exception:** The range **10.96.0.0 - 10.111.255.255** is **denied**.
  - This could be used to **block access to the Kubernetes Service IP range**, as the default Kubernetes **ClusterIP range** often falls within **10.96.0.0/12**.

### **Summary**
- **Pods with label `app=myService`** can send traffic to:
  1. The **specific IP** `20.1.1.1`.
  2. The **10.0.0.0/8** subnet **except** for `10.96.0.0/12`.
- **Traffic to other destinations is denied.**
- This setup is useful for **restricting** outbound traffic while allowing necessary access.
