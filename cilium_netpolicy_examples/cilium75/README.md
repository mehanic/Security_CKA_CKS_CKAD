### **Cilium Network Policy: `l7-rule`**  

This **CiliumNetworkPolicy** enforces **Layer 7 (L7) HTTP rules** on incoming (ingress) traffic for a specific set of pods.

---

## **Policy Breakdown**
```yaml
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: "l7-rule"
spec:
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myService
```
- **Applies to:** All pods labeled **`app: myService`**.  
- **Effect:** Defines **ingress (incoming) traffic rules** on **port `80` (HTTP)**.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Allows Specific HTTP Requests on Port 80**
```yaml
  ingress:
  - toPorts:
    - ports:
      - port: '80'
        protocol: TCP
```
- **Restricts ingress traffic** to **port `80` (TCP, HTTP)**.  
- **Blocks access to all other ports** unless additional rules permit them.

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Enforces L7 HTTP Rules**
```yaml
      rules:
        http:
        - method: GET
          path: "/path1$"
```
‚úÖ **Allows** `GET` requests to **`/path1`**.  
‚ùå **Blocks** `GET` requests to any other paths.

```yaml
        - method: PUT
          path: "/path2$"
          headers:
          - 'X-My-Header: true'
```
‚úÖ **Allows** `PUT` requests to **`/path2`**, **but only if** the request includes the **header**:  
   - **`X-My-Header: true`**  

‚ùå **Blocks** `PUT` requests to `/path2` if they do not contain this specific header.  
‚ùå **Blocks** `PUT` requests to **any other paths**.

---

## **Summary of Policy Effects**
| **Component**        | **Allowed** | **Blocked** |
|----------------------|------------|-------------|
| `GET /path1`        | ‚úÖ Allowed  | ‚ùå Denied for other paths |
| `PUT /path2` with `X-My-Header: true` | ‚úÖ Allowed | ‚ùå Denied if header is missing |
| Any other requests  | ‚ùå Blocked | ‚ùå Blocked |

---

## **Security & Benefits**
‚úÖ **Granular control** over HTTP traffic based on method, path, and headers.  
‚úÖ **Prevents unauthorized API access** by restricting certain paths.  
‚úÖ **Blocks unexpected traffic** to `/path2` unless it contains the correct header.  

Would you like to **extend this rule** to allow more HTTP methods, paths, or headers? üöÄ
