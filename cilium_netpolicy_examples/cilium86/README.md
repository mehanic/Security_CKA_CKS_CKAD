### **Cilium Network Policy: `fqdn`**

This Cilium Network Policy defines the rules for the pods with labels `org: empire` and `class: mediabot`. It specifies allowed **egress** traffic (outbound traffic) and provides access to both external FQDNs (Fully Qualified Domain Names) and internal services. Letâ€™s break down the key components.

---

### **Metadata**
```yaml
metadata:
  name: "fqdn"
```
- **Name**: The name of the policy is `fqdn`.

---

### **Endpoint Selector**
```yaml
endpointSelector:
  matchLabels:
    org: empire
    class: mediabot
```
- **Endpoint Selector**: This selector ensures that the policy is applied only to pods that have the labels `org: empire` and `class: mediabot`. In this case, the policy will be enforced on the `mediabot` pod defined in the subsequent `Pod` configuration.
  
  The `mediabot` pod has these exact labels, so the policy applies to it.

---

### **Egress Rules**
#### **1. Egress to an FQDN: `api.github.com`**
```yaml
egress:
  - toFQDNs:
      - matchName: "api.github.com"
```
- **toFQDNs**: This rule allows the `mediabot` pod to send outbound traffic to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) `api.github.com`.
  - **matchName**: This specifies that the traffic is allowed to the FQDN `api.github.com`, which corresponds to the GitHub API.
  
- **Effect**: The `mediabot` pod is permitted to make outbound requests to the GitHub API over the internet. This is useful for cases where the pod needs to interact with external APIs or services hosted on GitHub.

#### **2. Egress to Internal DNS Service (`openshift-dns`)**
```yaml
  - toEndpoints:
      - matchLabels:
          "k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace": openshift-dns
    toPorts:
    - ports:
        - port: "5353"
          protocol: ANY
      rules:
        dns:
          - matchPattern: "*"
```
- **toEndpoints**: This rule allows the `mediabot` pod to send traffic to the `openshift-dns` service.
  - The `matchLabels` field specifies that this rule applies to endpoints with the label `"k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace": openshift-dns`. This typically identifies the DNS service for an OpenShift cluster, where the DNS system resides in the `openshift-dns` namespace.

- **toPorts**: The allowed traffic is directed to **port 5353**, which is commonly used by DNS services.
  - **Protocol: ANY**: The protocol for the DNS traffic is not restricted, meaning both TCP and UDP are allowed.

- **rules**: 
  - **dns**: The rule defines that DNS queries are allowed with a `matchPattern: "*"`, meaning all DNS queries are allowed. This essentially enables DNS resolution for any domain name.

- **Effect**: The `mediabot` pod can communicate with the internal OpenShift DNS service (`openshift-dns`) on port 5353 for DNS lookups. The rule allows DNS traffic to any domain (`matchPattern: "*"`) via this service, enabling the pod to resolve domain names.

### **Pod Definition: `mediabot`**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mediabot
  labels:
    org: empire
    class: mediabot
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mediabot
    image: quay.io/cilium/json-mock:v1.3.8@sha256:5aad04835eda9025fe4561ad31be77fd55309af8158ca8663a72f6abb78c2603
```
- **Pod Selector**: This pod is labeled with `org: empire` and `class: mediabot`, which matches the selector in the network policy. This ensures that the policy is applied to this pod.
- **Container Image**: The container runs the image `quay.io/cilium/json-mock:v1.3.8@sha256:5aad04835eda9025fe4561ad31be77fd55309af8158ca8663a72f6abb78c2603`, which is a mock JSON service, likely used for testing purposes.

### **Summary of Policy Effects**

| **Traffic Direction** | **Source/Destination**                               | **Allowed Traffic**                                                     |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Egress (Outbound)** | **FQDN: api.github.com**                            | The `mediabot` pod is allowed to make requests to the GitHub API (`api.github.com`). |
| **Egress (Outbound)** | **Internal DNS Service (`openshift-dns`)**          | The `mediabot` pod can send DNS queries to the `openshift-dns` service on port 5353 (both TCP and UDP), resolving any domain name. |

### **Explanation of the Traffic Flow**

1. **Egress to GitHub API**:
   - The `mediabot` pod can send outbound HTTP(S) traffic to `api.github.com`, which is the GitHub API. This could be for interacting with GitHub's services, fetching repositories, or performing actions such as authentication.
   
2. **Egress to Internal DNS Service**:
   - The `mediabot` pod is allowed to send DNS queries to the internal DNS service (`openshift-dns`) in the OpenShift cluster. The pod can resolve domain names using this service, and it can query any domain, as the DNS query rule uses a wildcard match (`matchPattern: "*"`) for all domain names.

---

### **Use Cases for This Policy**

- **Access to External APIs**: The policy allows the `mediabot` pod to access external services, such as GitHub, which might be required for interacting with remote APIs or fetching external resources.
  
- **Internal DNS Resolution**: The pod is also permitted to resolve domain names using the internal DNS service (`openshift-dns`). This is useful for the pod to discover services or resolve any domain names within the OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster.

- **Testing and Debugging**: Given that the `mediabot` pod is running a mock service, this policy is likely designed to support testing scenarios where external and internal network access is required for specific communication.

---

### **Potential Improvements or Considerations**

- **Security Considerations**: The policy allows the pod to send DNS queries to any domain (`matchPattern: "*"`) via the OpenShift DNS service. While this is fine in most use cases, it could be restricted further to only allow queries to specific domains or services if desired, to reduce the attack surface.
  
- **FQDN Access**: If there are more FQDNs that need to be accessed by the `mediabot` pod, they can be added to the `toFQDNs` list. This can help extend the access to other external services.
