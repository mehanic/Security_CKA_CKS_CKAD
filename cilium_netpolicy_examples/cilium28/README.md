The provided `CiliumNetworkPolicy` is used to control the network traffic for pods labeled with `org: empire` and `class: mediabot`. The policy specifies rules for **egress** (outbound traffic) from those pods. 

Let's break it down:

### **CiliumNetworkPolicy Breakdown**

```yaml
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: "fqdn"
```
- **apiVersion**: The policy uses Cilium's `v2` API version.
- **kind**: This is a `CiliumNetworkPolicy` resource, used to enforce network security policies within Cilium.
- **metadata**:
  - **name**: The policy is named `fqdn`.

#### **Spec Section**

```yaml
spec:
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      org: empire
      class: mediabot
```
- **spec**: This is the specification of the policy.
  - **endpointSelector**: This selector matches the pods that the policy will apply to.
    - The policy is applied to pods with the labels:
      - `org: empire`
      - `class: mediabot`
    
These labels are used to target specific pods (e.g., all pods from the `empire` organization with the `mediabot` class).

#### **Egress Rules**

```yaml
egress:
  - toFQDNs:
    - matchName: "api.github.com"
```
- **egress**: Defines the outbound traffic (egress) rules for the selected pods.
  - **toFQDNs**: This rule allows outbound traffic to a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), specifically `api.github.com`. This means that pods with the labels `org: empire` and `class: mediabot` are allowed to communicate with `api.github.com` (this would generally be an external DNS resolution).
  
```yaml
  - toEndpoints:
      - matchLabels:
          "k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace": kube-system
          "k8s:k8s-app": kube-dns
    toPorts:
    - ports:
        - port: "53"
          protocol: ANY
      rules:
        dns:
          - matchPattern: "*"
```
- **toEndpoints**: This rule allows traffic to pods in the `kube-system` namespace with the label `k8s-app: kube-dns`, i.e., it allows communication to DNS services within the Kubernetes cluster.
  - **matchLabels**: The rule matches pods with the following labels:
    - `k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace: kube-system` (selecting the `kube-system` namespace)
    - `k8s:k8s-app: kube-dns` (selecting the DNS pods in `kube-system`)
  - **toPorts**: The traffic is allowed to port 53, which is the DNS service port for both TCP and UDP protocols.
  - **rules**: 
    - **dns**: The rule specifies that all DNS traffic (matching `*`) is allowed to the DNS service in `kube-system`. This is necessary for name resolution, as the pods are allowed to use DNS to resolve domain names (in this case, any domain as indicated by `matchPattern: "*"`, meaning "all domains").

### **Summary of Rules**

1. **Egress Traffic to FQDN**: The `mediabot` pods (with labels `org: empire` and `class: mediabot`) are allowed to send egress traffic to `api.github.com`. This rule is typically used to allow external communication, like calling an external API.

2. **Egress Traffic to DNS**: The `mediabot` pods are allowed to communicate with the `kube-dns` service within the `kube-system` namespace over UDP/TCP port 53 for DNS resolution. This enables the pods to perform DNS lookups for domain names, including for external resources.

### **In Summary:**
This policy allows the `mediabot` pods in the `empire` organization to:
- Reach `api.github.com` for API communication.
- Communicate with the `kube-dns` service for DNS resolution within the Kubernetes cluster. 

It ensures that `mediabot` pods can resolve domain names and access external APIs, but doesn't allow other types of outbound traffic.
