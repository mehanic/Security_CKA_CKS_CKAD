This YAML defines a **CiliumNetworkPolicy** in Kubernetes that enforces both **Layer 3 (L3)** and **Layer 7 (L7)** policies using Cilium. The policy regulates **ingress** (incoming) and **egress** (outgoing) traffic for specific pods based on labels, IP addresses (CIDR), and even HTTP methods and paths.

Let’s break down the YAML and explain each section:

### **Metadata**
```yaml
metadata:
  name: backend-policy
```
- `name: backend-policy`: This defines the name of the network policy, in this case, it's called `backend-policy`.

### **Spec (Specification)**

#### **1. Endpoint Selector**
```yaml
spec:
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: backend
```
- **`endpointSelector`**: This section selects the **pods** to which the policy applies. 
- **`matchLabels: tier: backend`**: This selects all pods that have the label `tier=backend`. This means the policy will be applied to all backend services.

#### **2. Ingress (Incoming Traffic)**

```yaml
  ingress:
    - fromEndpoints:
        - matchLabels:
            tier: frontend
      toPorts:
        - ports:
            - port: "80"
    - fromCIDRSet:
        - cidr: 172.224.3/32
      toPorts:
        - ports:
            - port: "80"
              protocol: TCP
          rules:
            http:
              - method: "GET"
                path: "/docs"
```

- **`ingress`**: Defines the incoming traffic rules for the backend pods.
  
  1. **Rule 1: From `frontend` pods to port 80**
     ```yaml
     - fromEndpoints:
         - matchLabels:
             tier: frontend
       toPorts:
         - ports:
             - port: "80"
     ```
     - **fromEndpoints**: The traffic is allowed only from pods labeled `tier=frontend`.
     - **toPorts**: Traffic from the `frontend` pods can only be received on **port 80** (e.g., HTTP requests).

  2. **Rule 2: From specific CIDR range (VPN server)**
     ```yaml
     - fromCIDRSet:
         - cidr: 172.224.3/32
       toPorts:
         - ports:
             - port: "80"
               protocol: TCP
           rules:
             http:
               - method: "GET"
                 path: "/docs"
     ```
     - **fromCIDRSet**: This rule allows ingress traffic from the IP `172.224.3/32`, which is the **VPN server**'s IP address.
     - **toPorts**: The traffic can only go to **port 80**.
     - **rules**: Defines Layer 7 (HTTP) filtering:
       - Only **HTTP GET** requests to the `/docs` path are allowed.
     
     This rule allows very specific access: traffic from the VPN server (IP: `172.224.3/32`) to port 80, but only if it’s an HTTP `GET` request targeting the `/docs` path.

#### **3. Egress (Outgoing Traffic)**

```yaml
  egress:
    - toEndpoints:
        - matchLabels:
            tier: database
      toPorts:
        - ports:
            - port: "7379"
    - toFQDNs:
        - matchPattern: "*.cloud.google.com"
      toPorts:
        - ports:
            - port: "443"
        - ports:
            - port: "80"
    - toEndpoints:
        - matchLabels:
            io.kubernetes.pod.namespace: kube-system
              k8s-app: kube-dns
      toPorts:
        - ports:
            - port: "53"
              protocol: UDP
          rules:
            dns:
              - matchPattern: "*"
```

- **`egress`**: Defines the outgoing traffic rules for the backend pods.

  1. **Rule 1: To `database` tier on port 7379**
     ```yaml
     - toEndpoints:
         - matchLabels:
             tier: database
       toPorts:
         - ports:
             - port: "7379"
     ```
     - **toEndpoints**: This rule allows egress traffic to pods labeled `tier=database`.
     - **toPorts**: The traffic can go to port **7379** (this might be the port for a database service such as Redis, for example).

  2. **Rule 2: To specific FQDNs (`*.cloud.google.com`) on ports 443 (HTTPS) and 80 (HTTP)**
     ```yaml
     - toFQDNs:
         - matchPattern: "*.cloud.google.com"
       toPorts:
         - ports:
             - port: "443"
             - port: "80"
     ```
     - **toFQDNs**: This rule allows egress traffic to **FQDNs** (Fully Qualified Domain Names) that match the pattern `*.cloud.google.com`, essentially allowing communication with any subdomain of `cloud.google.com` (likely for accessing services like Google Cloud APIs).
     - **toPorts**: The allowed egress ports are **443 (HTTPS)** and **80 (HTTP)**, which are standard for secure and non-secure web traffic.

  3. **Rule 3: To `kube-dns` service in `kube-system` namespace on UDP port 53 (DNS traffic)**
     ```yaml
     - toEndpoints:
         - matchLabels:
             io.kubernetes.pod.namespace: kube-system
             k8s-app: kube-dns
       toPorts:
         - ports:
             - port: "53"
               protocol: UDP
           rules:
             dns:
               - matchPattern: "*"
     ```
     - **toEndpoints**: This rule allows egress traffic to **DNS servers** running in the `kube-system` namespace, specifically to the pods with the labels `k8s-app=kube-dns`.
     - **toPorts**: Traffic can go to **port 53**, which is the standard DNS port, and it uses **UDP**.
     - **rules**: The `dns` rule allows any DNS queries (denoted by `matchPattern: "*"`) to be sent.

### **Summary**

This **CiliumNetworkPolicy** has both **ingress** and **egress** rules designed for **backend** tier pods:

- **Ingress Rules**:
  - Frontend pods (`tier=frontend`) can send HTTP traffic to port 80 of the backend pods.
  - The backend pods also allow traffic from a specific **VPN server IP** (`172.224.3/32`), but only HTTP `GET` requests to `/docs`.
  
- **Egress Rules**:
  - Backend pods can send traffic to **database** pods on port 7379.
  - Backend pods can access services under the `cloud.google.com` domain on ports 443 and 80.
  - Backend pods can send DNS queries (UDP port 53) to the `kube-dns` service in the `kube-system` namespace.

---

### **Key Points**

- **Layer 3 (L3)**: Controls traffic based on IP addresses and ports (e.g., `fromCIDRSet` for traffic from a specific IP).
- **Layer 7 (L7)**: Controls traffic based on HTTP request methods and paths (e.g., allowing only `GET` requests to `/docs`).
- **Egress Rules**: Govern outbound traffic, like accessing specific services, DNS queries, and HTTP traffic to specific external domains.
- **Granular Access Control**: Allows fine-grained control over network access, such as restricting access to specific HTTP paths and ports.

This is a highly granular network security policy designed to secure traffic between tiers of an application while allowing specific access from external sources like a VPN server or external domains.
