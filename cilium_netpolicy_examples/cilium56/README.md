This **CiliumNetworkPolicy** defines an **egress rule** for controlling traffic leaving the pods labeled `app=myService`. Specifically, it applies to **HTTPS traffic (port 443)** with a **specific SNI (Server Name Indication)** value. Here's a breakdown of the policy:

### **Breakdown of the Policy:**

#### **1. `endpointSelector`**
```yaml
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myService
```
- This section applies the policy to **pods labeled `app=myService`**.
- The policy controls the **egress traffic** (outbound traffic) originating from these selected pods.

#### **2. `egress` rule**
```yaml
  egress:
  - toPorts:
    - ports:
      - port: "443"
        protocol: TCP
      serverNames:
      - one.one.one.one
```
- **Egress traffic**: This rule controls the traffic **leaving** the `myService` pods. Specifically, it applies to traffic sent to **port 443** over **TCP**.
  
- **Port 443**: Port 443 is the standard port used for **HTTPS traffic**.
  
- **Protocol TCP**: This ensures the rule applies to **TCP-based traffic**, which is the transport protocol used for HTTPS.

- **SNI (Server Name Indication)**:
  - The policy also specifies the **serverNames** field under the **egress** rule.
  - The **SNI** is a field in the **TLS handshake** that allows a client to specify the hostname it's trying to connect to during an HTTPS connection.
  - In this case, the **SNI value** is set to `one.one.one.one`. This means that the egress traffic from `myService` pods is allowed to connect to servers that have the **SNI value** `one.one.one.one` during the **TLS handshake** on port 443 (typically an HTTPS service).
  
  **Note:** The **SNI** field is a mechanism for **hostname-based routing** in TLS, allowing servers to host multiple services under the same IP address but distinguish them based on the hostname (SNI) provided by the client.

### **Summary of the Policy:**
- The policy applies to pods labeled `app=myService`.
- It allows the **egress traffic** (outbound traffic) to **port 443** over **TCP**.
- The policy specifically allows connections that include the **Server Name Indication (SNI)** value of `one.one.one.one` in the TLS handshake, meaning the traffic is targeting a specific HTTPS service identified by that SNI.

### **Use Case:**
This policy would be useful in scenarios where:
- You want to restrict the egress traffic from `myService` pods to only be able to connect to a specific **HTTPS service** identified by the **SNI** `one.one.one.one`.
- This could be useful for enforcing strict security controls, ensuring that `myService` can only communicate with a particular HTTPS service or API, even though there might be many services on the same port (port 443) under different SNI values.
  
### **Important Notes:**
- This policy targets **HTTPS traffic (port 443)** and uses **SNI** to specify the allowed destination for the traffic. This allows for precise control over which HTTPS services the pods can communicate with, based on the hostname provided during the TLS handshake.
- The **SNI** is an essential feature for **multi-host** environments, especially in cases where multiple HTTPS services are hosted on the same IP address but differ by hostname.
