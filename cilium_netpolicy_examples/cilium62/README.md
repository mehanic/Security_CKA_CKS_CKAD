This **CiliumNetworkPolicy** defines egress traffic rules for pods with the label `any:org=alliance`. The policy controls DNS resolution and Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)-based traffic. Let's break down each section of this policy.

### **Breakdown of the Policy:**

#### **1. `metadata`**
```yaml
metadata:
  name: "tofqdn-dns-visibility"
```
- The **name** of the policy is `tofqdn-dns-visibility`. This suggests that the policy is aimed at managing DNS visibility and FQDN-based traffic for certain pods.

#### **2. `endpointSelector`**
```yaml
endpointSelector:
  matchLabels:
    any:org: alliance
```
- This selector targets the pods with the label `any:org=alliance`. The policy applies to the egress traffic from those specific pods.

#### **3. `egress` Rule 1 (DNS visibility)**

```yaml
egress:
  - toEndpoints:
      - matchLabels:
          "k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace": kube-system
          "k8s:k8s-app": kube-dns
    toPorts:
      - ports:
          - port: "53"
            protocol: ANY
        rules:
          dns:
            - matchPattern: "*"
```

This rule allows **DNS queries** from the `alliance` pods to the **kube-dns service** in the `kube-system` namespace.

- **`toEndpoints`**: The destination for the egress traffic is `kube-dns`, which is the DNS service in the `kube-system` namespace. This is the DNS resolver used by Kubernetes clusters.
  
- **`toPorts`**: The traffic is allowed on **port 53**, the standard port for DNS. The **protocol** is set to `ANY`, meaning the rule will apply for both UDP and TCP traffic.
  
- **`rules`** (DNS rules):
  - **`matchPattern: "*"`**: This rule allows DNS queries to any domain (wildcard `*`), meaning any DNS query can be made to any domain name, ensuring the pods can resolve any DNS name.

This part of the policy allows the `alliance` pods to send DNS queries to `kube-dns` and resolve any domain name.

#### **4. `egress` Rule 2 (FQDN-based access)**

```yaml
  - toFQDNs:
      - matchName: "cilium.io"
      - matchName: "sub.cilium.io"
      - matchPattern: "*.sub.cilium.io"
    toPorts:
      - ports:
          - port: "80"
            protocol: TCP
```

This rule controls outgoing HTTP traffic to certain Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs).

- **`toFQDNs`**: The `alliance` pods are allowed to send traffic to the following FQDNs:
  - **`cilium.io`**: The exact domain `cilium.io`.
  - **`sub.cilium.io`**: The exact domain `sub.cilium.io`.
  - **`*.sub.cilium.io`**: Any subdomain of `sub.cilium.io`. This allows access to domains like `api.sub.cilium.io`, `v1.sub.cilium.io`, etc.
  
- **`toPorts`**: The traffic is allowed on **port 80** (HTTP) with the **TCP** protocol. This restricts the allowed access to HTTP traffic.

This rule ensures that the `alliance` pods can make HTTP requests (TCP port 80) to the domains `cilium.io`, `sub.cilium.io`, and any subdomain of `sub.cilium.io`.

### **Summary of the Policy:**
- **Policy Name**: `tofqdn-dns-visibility`
- **Target**: Pods with the label `any:org=alliance`.
- **Egress Rules**:
  1. **DNS Resolution**: The `alliance` pods can send DNS queries to the `kube-dns` service on port 53, which can resolve any domain name (`*` wildcard).
  2. **FQDN Access**: The `alliance` pods are allowed to send HTTP (TCP port 80) requests to the following domains:
     - `cilium.io`
     - `sub.cilium.io`
     - Any subdomain of `sub.cilium.io` (e.g., `api.sub.cilium.io`).

### **Key Points:**
- **DNS Visibility**: The `alliance` pods can resolve DNS queries to any domain, as indicated by the `matchPattern: "*"`.
- **FQDN Access**: The `alliance` pods can access the listed domains over HTTP (port 80).
- **Protocol and Port Restrictions**: DNS traffic is allowed on port 53 for any protocol, while HTTP traffic is allowed on port 80 using TCP.

### **Example Use Case:**
- This policy could be used in a scenario where the `alliance` pods need to interact with services related to `cilium.io`, resolve DNS names for any domain, and make HTTP requests to specific domains like `cilium.io` and `sub.cilium.io`. This setup can be useful for controlling traffic within a Kubernetes cluster, allowing DNS resolution and access to specific services while maintaining security and traffic isolation.
