This **CiliumNetworkPolicy** defines **egress rules** for pods labeled with **app=test-app**, specifically controlling outbound traffic to specific **Kubernetes services** and **external FQDNs (Fully Qualified Domain Names)**.

### **Breakdown of the Policy:**

#### **1. `endpointSelector`**
```yaml
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: test-app
```
- This policy applies **only** to pods labeled with **`app=test-app`**.
- Other pods in the cluster **are not affected** by this policy.

#### **2. `egress` rules**
The `egress` section specifies what external resources the selected pods (with **`app=test-app`**) can connect to.

##### **Rule 1: Allow traffic to DNS in the `kube-system` namespace**
```yaml
  - toEndpoints:
      - matchLabels:
          "k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace": kube-system
          "k8s:k8s-app": kube-dns
    toPorts:
      - ports:
          - port: "53"
            protocol: ANY
        rules:
          dns:
            - matchPattern: "*"
```
- **Target**: Allows outbound traffic to the **DNS service** in the **`kube-system`** namespace, identified by the labels:
  - `"k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace": kube-system` (refers to the **`kube-system`** namespace).
  - `"k8s:k8s-app": kube-dns` (refers to the **DNS** service in the **`kube-system`** namespace).
  
- **Ports**: The traffic is allowed **on port 53** (which is the standard DNS port) and can use **any protocol**.
  
- **DNS Rules**:
  - The **DNS rule** allows DNS queries that match the **pattern `"*"`** (all domains). This means that any DNS request made by the **`test-app`** pods will be allowed as long as it is sent to the `kube-dns` service.

##### **Rule 2: Allow traffic to a specific external FQDN**
```yaml
  - toFQDNs:
      - matchName: "my-remote-service.com"
```
- **Target**: Allows traffic to a specific **external Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)**, `"my-remote-service.com"`.
- This allows the **`test-app`** pods to reach **`my-remote-service.com`**, which could be a service outside the Kubernetes cluster.

### **Summary of Allowed Traffic:**
- Pods with the label **`app=test-app`** can:
  1. **Send DNS requests** to the **`kube-dns`** service in the **`kube-system`** namespace (port 53, any protocol, any domain).
  2. **Access the external service** at **`my-remote-service.com`**.
  
- Any other **egress traffic** not specified by these rules would be **denied**.

This policy helps control both internal DNS communication and external HTTP/HTTPS access, making sure the pods can only reach the necessary services and external domains.
