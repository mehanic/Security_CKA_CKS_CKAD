### **Cilium Network Policy: `l4-rule`**  

This **CiliumNetworkPolicy** enforces a **Layer 4 (L4) rule** that controls **outgoing (egress) traffic** for specific pods based on ports and protocols.

---

## **Policy Breakdown**
```yaml
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: "l4-rule"
spec:
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myService
```
- **Applies to:** All pods with the label **`app: myService`**.  
- **Effect:** Defines **egress (outgoing) traffic rules** for these pods.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Allows Outgoing Traffic on Port 80 (HTTP)**
```yaml
  egress:
    - toPorts:
      - ports:
        - port: "80"
          protocol: TCP
```
- **Allows `myService` pods** to send **outgoing HTTP traffic (`TCP/80`)**.  
- **Blocks all other outbound traffic** (e.g., `TCP/443` for HTTPS, `UDP`, or other ports) unless additional policies permit them.

---

## **Summary of Policy Effects**
| **Component**   | **Allowed Communication**       | **Blocked Communication** |
|----------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `myService` pods | ‚úÖ Can send **HTTP requests** on `TCP/80` | ‚ùå Cannot send traffic on any **other port** (e.g., `443` for HTTPS) |
| Any other pods | ‚ùå Not affected by this policy | ‚ùå No special permissions granted |

---

## **Security Benefits**
‚úÖ **Tight egress control**: Ensures that `myService` can only communicate on `TCP/80`.  
‚úÖ **Prevents unintended data exfiltration**: Blocks unauthorized external communication.  
‚úÖ **Supports zero-trust networking**: Only explicitly allowed traffic is permitted.  

Would you like to **extend this policy** to allow **HTTPS (`TCP/443`) or specific IP ranges**? üöÄ
