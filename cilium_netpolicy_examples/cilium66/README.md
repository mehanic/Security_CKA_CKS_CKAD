This **CiliumNetworkPolicy** defines rules that allow outbound (egress) traffic from the pods in the `public` namespace to the `kube-dns` service within the `kube-system` namespace.

### Key Elements of the Policy:

```yaml
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: "allow-to-kubedns"
  namespace: public
spec:
  endpointSelector:
    {}
  egress:
  - toEndpoints:
    - matchLabels:
        k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace: kube-system
        k8s-app: kube-dns
    toPorts:
    - ports:
      - port: '53'
        protocol: UDP
```

#### 1. **Metadata**:
- **name**: `allow-to-kubedns` – This is the name of the policy.
- **namespace**: `public` – The policy is applied to the `public` namespace.

#### 2. **`endpointSelector`**:
- **`{}`** – The empty `endpointSelector` means that the policy applies to **all pods** in the `public` namespace. No specific label filtering is done on the source endpoints. This implies that the rule will apply to all pods in the `public` namespace regardless of their labels.

#### 3. **`egress`**:
- This section specifies the rules for **outgoing traffic** from the selected pods.
  
  - **`toEndpoints`**:
    - **`matchLabels`**:
      - `k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace: kube-system` – Traffic is allowed only to endpoints (pods) in the `kube-system` namespace.
      - `k8s-app: kube-dns` – Traffic is allowed only to pods with the label `k8s-app=kube-dns`. This targets the `kube-dns` service, which is typically responsible for DNS resolution within the Kubernetes cluster.

  - **`toPorts`**:
    - **`ports`**:
      - `port: '53'` – The rule allows traffic to port `53`, which is the default port for DNS services.
      - `protocol: UDP` – The traffic is allowed to use the **UDP protocol**. DNS typically operates over UDP, making this setting appropriate for DNS resolution.

#### 4. **Traffic Flow**:
- This policy allows **pods in the `public` namespace** to send **outgoing UDP traffic** to port `53` on the **`kube-dns` pods** in the `kube-system` namespace.

### **Summary**:
- The policy **allows all pods** in the `public` namespace to **send DNS queries** (UDP traffic on port 53) to the `kube-dns` service in the `kube-system` namespace.
- The traffic is directed specifically to the DNS service (identified by the label `k8s-app=kube-dns`) within the `kube-system` namespace, ensuring that only DNS traffic is allowed to flow to the `kube-dns` pods.
- This rule helps ensure that all pods in the `public` namespace have the ability to resolve DNS queries using the Kubernetes DNS service.
