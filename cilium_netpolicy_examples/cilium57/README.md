This **CiliumNetworkPolicy** defines an **ingress rule** that controls the **HTTP traffic** to the **`service`** application running in a Kubernetes pod. The rule allows only specific requests under certain conditions. Here's a detailed breakdown of the policy:

### **Breakdown of the Policy:**

#### **1. `metadata`**
```yaml
metadata:
  name: "rule1"
  description: "Allow HTTP GET /public from env=prod to app=service"
```
- **Name**: The name of this policy is `rule1`.
- **Description**: The policy description indicates that the rule is allowing **HTTP GET** requests to the `/public` path, but only from pods with the label `env=prod`, and only for the pods with the label `app=service`.

#### **2. `endpointSelector`**
```yaml
endpointSelector:
  matchLabels:
    app: service
```
- This part defines the **targeted endpoints** for this policy.
- The policy applies to **pods** that have the label `app=service`. So only the pods that match this label will be affected by the policy.

#### **3. `ingress` rule**
```yaml
ingress:
  - fromEndpoints:
    - matchLabels:
        env: prod
    toPorts:
    - ports:
      - port: "80"
        protocol: TCP
      rules:
        http:
        - method: "GET"
          path: "/public"
```
- **Ingress**: This section defines the **incoming traffic** (ingress) rules for the selected `service` pods.
- **fromEndpoints**: The traffic allowed by this rule is limited to those originating from pods with the label `env=prod`. In other words, only pods in the `prod` environment are allowed to send traffic to the `service` pods.
  
- **toPorts**: 
  - The rule applies to **TCP traffic** directed to **port 80**, which is typically used for HTTP traffic.
  
- **http rules**: 
  - The traffic must meet the following criteria:
    - The **HTTP method** must be `GET`.
    - The **HTTP path** must be `/public`.

### **Summary of the Policy:**
- The policy is applied to the pods labeled `app=service`.
- It allows **HTTP traffic (port 80)** only from pods labeled `env=prod`.
- The rule is further restricted to allow only **HTTP GET requests** to the `/public` path.

### **Use Case:**
This policy would be useful in scenarios such as:
- **Restricting access** to specific HTTP paths for certain environments. For example, only allowing HTTP `GET` requests to `/public` from production (`prod`) environment pods to access the `service` app.
- **Enhancing security** by enforcing that only specific methods (`GET`) and paths (`/public`) are accessible to certain users or applications (in this case, those in the `prod` environment).
- **Enabling fine-grained control** over which services and endpoints can be accessed based on environment labels, enforcing access restrictions for different parts of your application.

### **Key Points:**
- The policy applies to specific **pods** labeled with `app=service`.
- It restricts the **incoming HTTP traffic** to only the **GET requests** targeting `/public` from **pods labeled `env=prod`**.
- The rule enhances the security of the `service` app by only allowing certain types of traffic (both method and path restricted).

This is a great example of how Cilium Network Policies can provide granular control over HTTP traffic, not just based on IPs or ports, but also on HTTP methods and paths, while integrating Kubernetes labels for environment-based access control.
