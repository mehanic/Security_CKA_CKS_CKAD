  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web-server  # Selects pods with label app=web-server
  ingress:
    - fromEntities:
        - cluster         # Allow traffic from all endpoints inside the local cluster
        - kube-apiserver  # Allow traffic from the Kubernetes API server
  egress:
    - toEntities:
        - world          # Allow outbound traffic to external endpoints
        - host           # Allow communication with the host machine

# Explanation:
# endpointSelector: app=web-server â†’ This policy applies to all pods with label app=web-server.
# Ingress Rules (fromEntities):
# Allows traffic from within the cluster (cluster).
# Allows traffic from the Kubernetes API server (kube-apiserver).
# Egress Rules (toEntities):
# Allows outbound traffic to the internet (world).
# Allows outbound traffic to the host machine (host).
# Possible Use Cases:
# Restricting ingress to only internal cluster traffic.
# Allowing specific communication to external services.
# Controlling pod-to-host interactions securely.
