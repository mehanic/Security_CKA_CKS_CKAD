This **CiliumNetworkPolicy** defines an **egress rule** for the pods labeled with `app=myService`. The rule specifically controls outbound traffic from these pods.

### **Breakdown of the Policy:**

#### **1. `endpointSelector`**
```yaml
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myService
```
- This policy is applied **only** to the pods that have the label `app=myService`.
- Other pods in the cluster that do not have this label will **not be affected** by this policy.

#### **2. `egress` rule**
```yaml
  egress:
    - toPorts:
      - ports:
        - port: "80"
          protocol: TCP
```
- This rule allows **outbound traffic (egress)** from the selected pods (`app=myService`).
  
- The traffic is allowed to **port 80** (the standard HTTP port) using the **TCP protocol**. This implies that the selected pods can send traffic to any destination **on port 80 using TCP**.

### **Summary of the Policy:**
- Pods labeled with `app=myService` can **send outbound traffic** to any destination **on port 80** using **TCP**.
- Any other **egress traffic** that does not match this rule will be **denied**.

### **Use Case:**
This policy can be used when you want to allow pods in your service (`myService`) to access HTTP-based services (e.g., external websites or services running on port 80). However, any traffic to other ports or using other protocols will be blocked.
