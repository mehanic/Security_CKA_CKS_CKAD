This **CiliumNetworkPolicy** defines the rules for controlling **egress traffic** from pods labeled `any:org=alliance` in a Kubernetes cluster. It manages both **DNS resolution** and **FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)-based access** for outgoing traffic. Let's break down the policy:

### **Breakdown of the Policy:**

#### **1. `metadata`**
```yaml
metadata:
  name: "tofqdn-dns-visibility"
```
- The **name** of the policy is `tofqdn-dns-visibility`. This is a descriptive name indicating that this policy governs DNS visibility and FQDN-based access.

#### **2. `endpointSelector`**
```yaml
endpointSelector:
  matchLabels:
    any:org: alliance
```
- This **endpointSelector** targets the pods that are labeled with `any:org=alliance`. This means the policy applies to the pods in the `alliance` organization. Only those pods will be affected by the egress rules defined in this policy.

#### **3. `egress` Rule 1 (DNS visibility)**

```yaml
egress:
  - toEndpoints:
      - matchLabels:
          "k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace": kube-system
          "k8s:k8s-app": kube-dns
    toPorts:
      - ports:
          - port: "53"
            protocol: ANY
        rules:
          dns:
            - matchName: "cilium.io"
            - matchPattern: "*.cilium.io"
            - matchPattern: "*.api.cilium.io"
```
This rule governs DNS traffic and allows outgoing DNS queries from the `alliance` pods to the **Kubernetes DNS service (kube-dns)** in the `kube-system` namespace.

- **`toEndpoints`**: The destination for the egress traffic is the `kube-dns` service in the `kube-system` namespace. This is the DNS resolver used by the cluster for DNS queries.

- **`toPorts`**: The egress traffic is allowed on **port 53**, which is the standard DNS port. The protocol is set to `ANY`, meaning it will support both UDP and TCP traffic for DNS resolution.

- **`rules` (DNS rules)**:
  - **`matchName: "cilium.io"`**: The DNS query will be allowed if the requested domain is `cilium.io`.
  - **`matchPattern: "*.cilium.io"`**: The DNS query will be allowed for any subdomain of `cilium.io`, for example, `api.cilium.io`, `v1.cilium.io`, etc.
  - **`matchPattern: "*.api.cilium.io"`**: Similarly, any subdomain of `api.cilium.io`, such as `v1.api.cilium.io`, `app.api.cilium.io`, etc., will be allowed.

This part of the policy ensures that the `alliance` pods can resolve `cilium.io` and its subdomains using the Kubernetes DNS service (`kube-dns`).

#### **4. `egress` Rule 2 (FQDN-based access)**

```yaml
  - toFQDNs:
      - matchName: "cilium.io"
      - matchName: "sub.cilium.io"
      - matchName: "service1.api.cilium.io"
      - matchPattern: "special*service.api.cilium.io"
    toPorts:
      - ports:
          - port: "80"
            protocol: TCP
```
This rule governs **HTTP traffic** (on TCP port 80) to specific **FQDNs** (Fully Qualified Domain Names).

- **`toFQDNs`**: The `alliance` pods are allowed to send HTTP traffic to the following FQDNs:
  - **`cilium.io`**: The exact domain `cilium.io`.
  - **`sub.cilium.io`**: The exact domain `sub.cilium.io`.
  - **`service1.api.cilium.io`**: The exact domain `service1.api.cilium.io`.
  - **`special*service.api.cilium.io`**: Any domain that starts with `special` and ends with `service.api.cilium.io`. For example, `special-service.api.cilium.io` or `special-api.service.api.cilium.io` would be allowed.

- **`toPorts`**: The allowed traffic to these FQDNs is restricted to **port 80** (HTTP) and **TCP protocol**. This means the `alliance` pods can only access these domains over HTTP.

This part of the policy ensures that the `alliance` pods can access specific services over HTTP (port 80) for the listed FQDNs.

### **Summary of the Policy:**
- **Policy Name**: `tofqdn-dns-visibility`
- **Target**: Pods with the label `any:org=alliance`.
- **Egress Rules**:
  1. **DNS Resolution**: The `alliance` pods can resolve DNS records for `cilium.io`, its subdomains (e.g., `*.cilium.io`), and `api.cilium.io` subdomains. This DNS query is directed to the `kube-dns` service on port 53.
  2. **FQDN Access**: The `alliance` pods can make HTTP requests (TCP port 80) to specific FQDNs, such as `cilium.io`, `sub.cilium.io`, `service1.api.cilium.io`, and domains matching the pattern `special*service.api.cilium.io`.

### **Key Points:**
- **DNS Visibility**: This policy allows the `alliance` pods to perform DNS lookups for `cilium.io` and related domains, which is necessary for internal cluster DNS resolution.
- **FQDN Access**: The `alliance` pods can make HTTP requests to specific services (on port 80) associated with `cilium.io` and related domains.
- **Port and Protocol Restrictions**: The policy restricts DNS traffic to port 53 and HTTP traffic to port 80, ensuring the traffic is limited to specific use cases.

### **Example Use Case:**
In this setup, the `alliance` pods are allowed to:
1. Perform DNS resolution for Cilium-related services (`cilium.io`, `api.cilium.io`).
2. Access services over HTTP on port 80 for specific domains, such as `cilium.io` and `sub.cilium.io`, and even more specific services like `special*service.api.cilium.io`.

This policy is useful in environments where you want to control which domains can be resolved and accessed by specific pods, especially when integrating with services that are part of a larger system or infrastructure, like Cilium.
