### **Cilium Network Policy: `l3-rule`**  

This **CiliumNetworkPolicy** defines a **Layer 3 (L3) rule**, controlling **which pods can communicate** based on their labels.  

---

## **Policy Breakdown**
```yaml
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: "l3-rule"
spec:
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: backend
```
- **Applies to:** Pods labeled **`role: backend`**.  
- **Effect:** Defines **ingress (incoming) traffic rules** for these pods.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Allow Incoming Traffic from `frontend` Pods**
```yaml
  ingress:
  - fromEndpoints:
    - matchLabels:
        role: frontend
```
- **Allows only pods labeled `role: frontend`** to send traffic to `backend` pods.  
- **Blocks traffic from any other source**, unless additional policies allow it.

---

## **Summary of Policy Effects**
| **Component**   | **Allowed Communication**       | **Blocked Communication** |
|----------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `frontend` pods | ‚úÖ Can send traffic to `backend` pods | ‚ùå Cannot talk to any other pods |
| `backend` pods  | ‚ùå Cannot initiate traffic to `frontend` (only accepts connections) | ‚ùå Cannot receive traffic from non-`frontend` pods |

---

## **Security Benefits**
‚úÖ **Enforces microservice isolation**: Only `frontend` pods can talk to `backend`.  
‚úÖ **Reduces attack surface**: Blocks unintended access from unauthorized services.  
‚úÖ **Simple L3 enforcement**: No need for additional ports or protocol rules.
