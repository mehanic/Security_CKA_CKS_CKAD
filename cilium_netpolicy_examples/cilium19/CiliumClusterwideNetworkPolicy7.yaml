# The EnableDefaultDeny field in a Cilium network policy is used to enforce a default deny-all behavior for ingress and/or egress traffic.

# Purpose:
# When EnableDefaultDeny is set, it ensures that all traffic is denied by default, and only explicitly allowed traffic (as defined in CiliumNetworkPolicy rules) is permitted.
# This is useful for implementing a zero-trust security model, where all network communication is blocked unless explicitly defined.
# How It Works:
# By default, Cilium allows all traffic unless a policy restricts it.
# Enabling EnableDefaultDeny ensures that any traffic not matching an explicit allow rule is dropped.
# It can be applied to either ingress, egress, or both, depending on policy configuration.
