spec:

  enableDefaultDeny:
    ingress: true
    egress: true

# The EnableDefaultDeny field in a Cilium network policy is used to enforce a default deny-all traffic policy for both ingress and egress connections. This means that unless explicitly allowed by other rules, all traffic will be blocked.

# Purpose of EnableDefaultDeny:
# Implements a Zero-Trust Model: Ensures that no unintended communication occurs within the cluster.
# Overrides Default Behavior: By default, Cilium allows all traffic unless a policy restricts it. Enabling EnableDefaultDeny ensures that only explicitly allowed traffic is permitted.
# Enhances Security: It acts as a safeguard against unauthorized access by blocking all traffic unless explicitly allowed.
# How It Works:
# When EnableDefaultDeny is enabled:

# Ingress and/or egress traffic is denied by default.
# Only explicitly defined CiliumNetworkPolicy rules allow traffic.
