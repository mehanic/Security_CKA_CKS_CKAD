### **CiliumNetworkPolicy: Allowing Traffic from Init Containers**  

This **CiliumNetworkPolicy** allows traffic from **init containers** to a pod labeled `app: myService`.  

---

## **Policy Breakdown**
```yaml
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: "from-init"
spec:
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myService
  ingress:
    - fromEntities:
      - init
    - toPorts:
      - ports:
        - port: "53"
          protocol: UDP
```
---

## **Explanation**
1. **Applies to Pods with `app: myService`**  
   - The `endpointSelector` ensures **this rule applies only to** pods labeled `app: myService`.

2. **Allows Incoming Traffic from Init Containers**  
   - The `fromEntities` section allows ingress traffic **only from `init` containers**.
   - Init containers run **before the main application containers** in a pod.  
   - This means **init containers** can now send traffic to `myService` during startup.

3. **Permits UDP Traffic on Port 53** (DNS Resolution)  
   - The `toPorts` rule allows UDP traffic **on port 53**, which is used for **DNS queries**.  
   - This means init containers can perform **DNS lookups** (e.g., resolving service names before the main container starts).  

---

## **What This Means**
✅ **Allows traffic from init containers** (e.g., for setup, configuration, or dependency checks).  
✅ **Ensures init containers can perform DNS queries** to resolve hostnames before the main application starts.  
✅ **Restricts traffic sources** to only **init** containers, **not allowing traffic from other sources**.  

---

## **Use Case**
- Init containers often **download dependencies**, **fetch secrets**, or **perform startup configurations** before the main application runs.  
- This policy ensures that they can **reach `myService` and resolve DNS** if needed but **blocks all other traffic sources**.  
- **Security benefit:** Prevents unnecessary exposure from external entities while still allowing essential startup operations.
